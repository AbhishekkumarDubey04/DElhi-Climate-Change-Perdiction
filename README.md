# DElhi-Climate-Change-Perdiction

This project aims to analyze historical climate data for Delhi, India, and develop predictive models to forecast future climate trends. By leveraging Python's data analysis libraries, the project will:

Collect and preprocess data: Gather and clean climate data from reliable sources.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data.
Feature engineering: Create new features to improve model performance.
Model selection and training: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms to predict future climate variables.
Model evaluation and refinement: Assess and refine model performance.
Visualization and interpretation: Visualize and interpret predicted climate trends.
Key Findings

**Rising temperatures:**
Delhi has experienced a consistent increase in average temperatures over the years.
Inverse relationship between temperature and humidity: As temperatures rise, humidity tends to decrease.
Seasonal fluctuations: Wind speeds show seasonal variations, with higher speeds during monsoon and retreating monsoon seasons.
Potential for outliers: Unusual weather events can disrupt predicted trends.
